<p class="lead text-left">The following rules are used for loot distribution</p>
<p class="text-left"> Guild raids will run <i>Loot Council</i> for loot distribution.<br/>
This post explains how the loot system will actually function for loot distribution in raids</p>

<p>Firstly for this to function, every raid member is expected to download and install the 
<a href="https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/rclootcouncil">RC Loot Council Addon</a>. When Running 
this addon, loot that drops off the boss will be displayed and you will be presented with options to 
select for each piece of gear. You can select whether the item is a major upgrade for you, a minor 
upgrade, for your offspec or if you simply wish to pass. </p><br/>
<p>When selecting the option you can also write a reason for doing so if you wish (eg writing THIS IS MY BEST IN SLOT TRINKET) or something like that. Additional options for tier pieces indicating if it will give your 4p/2p bonus are also shown.</p>

<p> Once you select an option, this is fed through to the loot council who can then see quickly and simply who is interested in each piece of loot. From there loot will be distributed based on the following guidelines.</p>

<ol>
<li>Main spec before offspec</li>
<li>Main character before alts</li>
<li>Who gets the largest upgrade / benefit from the piece</li>
<li>(eg a trinket like Draught of Souls which was far better for warriors than everyone else)</li>
<li>Raiders get prio over trials</li>
</ol>

<p>In general loot will be funnelled to DPS, then Tanks and lastly healers. This is mostly relevant when we progress a new raid and distributing tier etc to ensure the greatest bonus to the raid as a whole. (Note depending on how bosses are for Antorus this may change, but this order is pretty typical for most tiers).</p><br/>
<p>To ensure transparency and fairness when there is multiple people interested in loot the members of the loot council will vote to confirm they are in agreement on who should receive the piece. </p>
<p>If any member of the raid feels that a piece has been distributed unfairly they can message me after the raid and I will provide the reasoning.
Below are a couple of examples of loot situations and how it would be dealt with:</p>
<h4>Scenario 1</h4>
<p>Sea star of the depthmother (920 Warforged) drops.<br/>
Shaman and a Paladin both want the trinket.<br/>
Both classes have this as a top trinket, Shaman already has a Sea star at ilvl 915. Paladin doesnâ€™t yet have the trinket.<br/>
In this scenario the Paladin would receive the loot as ensuring both have the trinket is preferable to a 5ilvl increase for a single person.<br/></p>

<h4>Scenario 2</h4>
<p>New tier is out, first week of gearing.<br/>
Token for the helm drops<br/>
A Warlock / Paladin / Priest Dps all roll for the token.<br/>
Warlock and Paladin have 2 pieces of the set whereas the Priest has 3.<br/>
In this scenario the loot would go to the priest in order for his 4piece bonus to be obtained. <br/></p>
