<p class="lead">With patch 7.3.5 right around the corner we're finally moving into our first full raid tier as a guild! We've had incredible success in Tomb of Sargeras but we do need to tighten up the raid team ahead of Antorus. </p>

<p>If you have any questions please contact one of the leadership team as soon as possible. These rules are designed to make sure we make effective use of our time, particularly in the first few weeks of progress.</p>

<p class="lead">
So lets have a quick look at some of the guild changes ahead of Antorus and what we expect from all our raid team.

		<p>Ahead of our first raid on November 30th, please take the time to watch some raid videos from either of the following.</p>
		<ul class="list-group">
			<li class="list-group-item"><h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMGVp_GnkhHZROIfRdXpo4Q">Hazel Nutty Games</a></h2></li>

		<h1>Raid Attendance</h1>

		<img class="img img-responsive" src="/img/summon.jpg" style="max-width: 60% !important"/>
		<p>In order to ensure a smooth raid environment as we move into the new tier. Raids will now be starting at 20:30 (server time) sharp.</p>
		<p>In the interest of time and getting the maxmimum progress per night, we want the raids to get going a.s.a.p. meaning we're now going to start invites at 20:20 (server time). When running late please make every effort to contact one of the leadership team.</p>
		<p>For clarity. If there is no name on the sign-up roster, it will be assumed you are not going on any given evening. So please make sure you sign up as soon as you can (sign ups are available now!).</p>

		<h1>Optional Extra Raid Night</h1>

		<br/>
		<p>For the first few weeks following the launch of 7.3.5, there will be an extra raid night available on a Tuesday. This is available on the calendars right now and is entirely optional!</p>
		<p>These raids are for anyone who can make it and will allow us to squeeze every last drop of delicious progress out of the first week! In future tuesday's may become a normal clear for gear runs whilst focusing Monday &amp; Thursday for Heroic / Mythic progress. </p>

		<h1>Raid Ettiquete</h1>
		<img class="img img-responsive" src="/img/test.png"/>
		<p class="text-center"><b>No leaving the raid zone or group while the raid is in progress!</b></p>
		<br/>
		<p>We know that new shiny relic needs to be netherforged and there is that one world quest which will give you limitless bacon.... however... Leaving the raid and forcing a resummon really does waste everyones time, we will always try to make sure that a break is put in around half way through the raid so then is the perfect time to do what you need to!</p>

			<p> We've all done it.. every single one of us... The new patch hits, we login get to the raid &amp; we hear the raid leader say 'PULLING'.
			wait.... shouldn't dbm have shown a cooldown..? </p>
			<p> Yes we all forget to update our addons but this time there is no excuse! <b>UPDATE YOUR ADDONS!</b></p>
			<p>We plan to make heavy use of the notes function in Exorsus and we will have pre-assigned people to mechanics to speed things up. Remember <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2">Weak auras</a> is mandatory as we will be sharing various weak auras throughout Antorus</p>

		<br/>
		<p>Don't loot lock yourself before the 30th. We know it's really tempting to jump ahead into the exciting new raid and that pug seems like a good idea.. but... If you jump the gun you will mess up the loot for everyone else! Hang in for just one more day!</p>

		<p> Ok folks thats the rants over with! Our progress so far in Tomb of Sargeras has been incredible and with these rules in place we should be in an even better place for Antorus. </p>
		<p> So now it's time to sharpen your axe, buy potions from the potion master and prepare for our first full raid tier as Defenestrate!</p>
