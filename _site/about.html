## About

Defenestrate is a newly formed guild located on Tarren mill intent on maintaining a 2 day a week raiding 
guild while keeping up with irl at the same time. We are currently 4/9 Mythic and are prepairing for Antorus.

Our aim is cutting edge, to achieve this we will be raiding two days a week, <i>Monday</i> and <i>Thursday</i>. 

<h3>Attendance</h3>
<p>We prefer people to have as close to 100% attendance as possible for raids, however we understand that real life is always priority.</p>

<h3>Loot Distribution</h3>
<p>All loot is distributed, via a 3 man loot council, with all loot being awarded to the player able to most benefit from said loot.</p>

We're currently recruiting talented players to join our ranks in preparation for Antorus, the burning throne. Please see our <a href="#contact">Contact Section</a> for our current recruitment options.
